# Geode for VS Code

Support for the [Geode](https://geode-sdk.github.io/docs/) [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) modding framework.

This is a rewrite of the previous `geode-support` extension.

## Features

 * Launch GD (`Geode: Launch Geometry Dash` command).
 * Validation for `mod.json`
 * Sprite browser (Use the `Ctrl + Alt + B` shortcut to launch, or `Geode: Open Sprite Browser`)

## To-do

 * Generate classes
 * Possibly some sort of Clippy feature?
